# ListPresentation
 Project created for the "Data Structures" discipline wich lets you build a simple or double chained list using a visual library called pygame.
 Unfortunately it is not compiled, wich means you cannot use it unless you install both python and pygame.
 To at least give an idea of the project's functionality, i attached a few pictures in the "Pictures" folder.
